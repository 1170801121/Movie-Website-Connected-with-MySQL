# Movie Website Connected with MySQL
It is a website imitating the *MaoYan Movie* to connect with MySQL Database. I establish this project to learn to how to apply MySQL taught in my *Database Systems* course into real applications. 

Besides, I realized functions that users could login as customers or administrators with different permissions. And I also added animation effects for login and registration pages, and used 3D seat perspective to help select seats and purchase tickets.
